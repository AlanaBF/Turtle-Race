# Turtle Race

## Overview

Turtle Race is a fun, interactive game that allows players to bet on which turtle will win a race. Initially inspired by a Python course project using the Turtle package, this project evolved into a full-fledged game using Pygame and Pygbag, making it deployable on the web for anyone to play.

## Why I Built This

The inspiration for this project came from my ongoing journey to master Python. After creating a simple Turtle Race using the Turtle package, I wanted to make the game accessible to a wider audience. This led me to explore Pygame for game development and Pygbag for deploying Python games on the web. The game you're about to experience is a recreation of that Turtle Race but with a more generalised approach using Pygame.

## Features

- Interactive Gameplay: Players can place bets on which turtle (represented by colored squares) they think will win the race.
- Randomised Race Mechanics: The race outcome is randomised, making each game unique.
- Responsive Design: The game scales well to different screen sizes.
- Web Deployment: Using Pygbag, the game can be played directly in a web browser without the need for any installations.

## Installation

To run the game locally, you'll need Python installed on your machine along with the required dependencies. Follow these steps:

1 Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlanaBF/Turtle-Race
cd turtle-race
```

2 Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Python installed, and then install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install pygame asyncio
```

3 Run the Game: Execute the Python script to start the game:

```bash
python main.py
```

## How to Play

1 Place Your Bet: At the start of the game, you will be prompted to choose a color representing one of the turtles. Type your choice and submit it.

2 Watch the Race: The turtles will race across the screen, with the winner being declared at the end.

3 Play Again: After the race, youâ€™ll be given the option to play again or exit the game.

## Deployment

The game is also deployable on the web using Pygbag. Follow these steps to deploy the game on GitHub Pages:

1 Prepare the Project for Web Deployment:

- Install Pygbag:

```bash
pip install pygbag
```

- Build the project for the web:

```bash
pygbag main.py
```

2 Deploy to GitHub Pages:

- Commit the built files (located in the build/web directory) to the gh-pages branch of your GitHub repository.
- Go to the repository settings on GitHub and enable GitHub Pages, selecting the gh-pages branch as the source.

3 Access the Game:

- Once deployed, your game will be accessible at https://yourusername.github.io/turtle-race/.

## Example Code

Here is the initial Turtle Race code that inspired this project:

```python
import random
from turtle import Turtle, Screen
from tkinter import messagebox
import asyncio

async def main():
    def start_race():
        is_race_on = False
        screen = Screen()
        screen.setup(width=500, height=400)
        user_bet = screen.textinput(title="Make your bet", prompt="Which turtle will win the race? Choose a color: ")
        colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple"]
        y_positions = [-100, -50, 0, 50, 100, 150]
        all_turtles = []

        for turtle_index in range(0, 6):
            new_turtle = Turtle(shape="turtle")
            new_turtle.color(colors[turtle_index])
            new_turtle.penup()
            new_turtle.goto(x=-230, y=y_positions[turtle_index])
            all_turtles.append(new_turtle)
            
        if user_bet:
            is_race_on = True

        while is_race_on:
            for turtle in all_turtles:
                if turtle.xcor() > 230:
                    is_race_on = False
                    winning_color = turtle.pencolor()
                    if winning_color == user_bet:
                        print(f"You've won! The {winning_color} turtle is the winner!")
                        messagebox.showinfo("You've won", f"The {winning_color} turtle is the winner!")
                    else:
                        print(f"You've lost! The {winning_color} turtle is the winner!")
                        messagebox.showinfo("You've lost", f"The {winning_color} turtle is the winner!")
                    play_again = messagebox.askyesno("Game Over", "Do you want to play again?")
                    if play_again:
                        screen.clearscreen()
                        start_race()
                    else:
                        screen.bye()
                    break
                random_distance = random.randint(0, 10)
                turtle.forward(random_distance)

        screen.exitonclick()

    start_race()
    await asyncio.sleep(0)  # Very important, and keep it 0
asyncio.run(main())
```

## Future Improvements

- Add More Visual Effects: Enhance the race with animations and visual effects.
- Improve User Interface: Create a more polished user interface with additional interaction elements.
- Mobile Compatibility: Optimize the game for mobile devices.
