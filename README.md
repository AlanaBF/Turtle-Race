## Overview

Turtle Race is a fun, basic, interactive game that allows players to bet on which turtle will win a race. Initially inspired by a Python course project using the Turtle package, this project evolved into a game using Pygame and Pygbag, making it deployable on the web for anyone to play.

## Why I Built This

The inspiration for this project came from my ongoing journey to master Python. After creating a simple Turtle Race using the Turtle package, I wanted to make the game accessible to a wider audience. This led me to explore Pygame for game development and Pygbag for deploying Python games on the web. The game you're about to experience is a recreation of that Turtle Race but with a more generalised approach using Pygame.

## Features

- Interactive Gameplay: Players can place bets on which turtle (represented by colored squares) they think will win the race.
- Randomised Race Mechanics: The race outcome is randomised, making each game unique.
- Responsive Design: The game scales well to different screen sizes.
- Web Deployment: Using Pygbag, the game can be played directly in a web browser without the need for any installations.

## Getting Started

You can play the Turtle Race game online or run it locally on your machine. Follow the instructions below to get started!

## Installation

To run the game locally, you'll need Python installed on your machine along with the required dependencies. Follow these steps:

1 Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlanaBF/Turtle-Race
cd turtle-race
```

2 Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Python installed, and then install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install pygame asyncio
```

3 Run the Game: Execute the Python script to start the game:

```bash
python main.py
```

## How to Play

1 Place Your Bet: At the start of the game, you will be prompted to choose a color representing one of the turtles. Type your choice and submit it.

2 Watch the Race: The turtles will race across the screen, with the winner being declared at the end.

3 Play Again: After the race, youâ€™ll be given the option to play again or exit the game.

## Deployment

The game is also deployable on the web using Pygbag. Follow these steps to deploy the game on GitHub Pages:

1 Prepare the Project for Web Deployment:

- Install Pygbag:

```bash
pip install pygbag
```

- Build the project for the web:

```bash
pygbag main.py
```

2 Deploy to GitHub Pages:

- Commit the built files (located in the build/web directory) to the gh-pages branch of your GitHub repository.
- Go to the repository settings on GitHub and enable GitHub Pages, selecting the gh-pages branch as the source.

3 Access the Game:

- Once deployed, your game will be accessible at [Turtle Race Game](https://alanabf.github.io/Turtle-Race/).

## Future Improvements

Here are some ideas for future development:

- **Visual Effects:** Add animations and special effects to make the race more engaging.
- **User Interface:** Improve the UI with more polished interaction elements.
- **Mobile Compatibility:** Optimise the game for a better experience on mobile devices.
